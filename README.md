### The OfficerDemoWordOnly folder contains these files:    

* **dataset_Facebook.csv** - the sample data set I used in my code, which can be found on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/roxannac/facebook-data)  
* **Demo_Report.docx** - this is the Word document that was created by the Officer code in my .Rmd file. When you open the project, feel free to inspect this document, then DELETE IT so that your project can create your own Demo_Report file!    
* **Officer_Demo.Rmd** - this is my Rmarkdown file that contains all my notes, data manipulation, and officer code  
* **OfficerDemoWordOnly.Rproj** - this is the Rstudio project file that accompanies this directory
